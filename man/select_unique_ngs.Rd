select_unique_ngs(
  data_cohort,
  oncotree_code = NULL,
  sample_type = NULL,
  min_max_time = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_cohort}{output object of the create_analytic_cohort function.}

\item{oncotree_code}{character vector specifying which sample
OncoTree codes to keep. See "cpt_oncotree_code" column
of data_cohort argument above to get options.}

\item{sample_type}{character specifying which type of genomic sample
to prioritize, options are "Primary", "Local" and "Metastasis".
Default is to not select a NGS sample based on the sample type.}

\item{min_max_time}{character specifying if the first or last genomic
sample recorded should be kept.
Options are "min" (first) and "max" (last).}
}
\value{
returns the 'cohort_ngs' object of the create_analytic_cohort
with unique genomic samples taken from each patients.

\description{
For patients with multiple associated next generation (NGS)
sequencing reports, select one unique NGS report per patient for the purpose
of creating an analytic dataset based on user-defined criterion, including
OncoTree code, primary vs. metastatic tumor sample, and earliest vs. most
recent sample. If multiple reports for a patient remain available after the
user-defined specifications, or if no specifications are provided, the panel
with the largest number of genes is selected by default. Sample optimization
is performed in the order that the arguments are specified in the function,
regardless of the argumentsâ€™ order provided by the user. Namely, the OncoTree
code is prioritized first, sample type is prioritized second and finally the
time is prioritized last. For patients with exactly one genomic sample, that
unique genomic sample will be returned regardless of whether it meets the
user-specified parameters. Running the select_unique_ngs() function will
ensure that the resulting dataset returned by merging the next generation
sequencing report data onto the cohort_ca_dx dataset returned by
create_analytic_cohort() will maintain the structure of cohort_ca_dx (either
one record per patient or one record per diagnosis). Currently, if multiple
diagnoses per patient are returned from create_analytic_cohort(), using
select_unique_ngs() will select a single NGS report per patient. In
future iterations, this will be updated so that one NGS report per diagnosis
can be selected.
}
\details{
Note that the NGS dataset serves as the link between the clinical and
genomic data, where the NGS dataset includes one record per NGS report per
patient, including the NGS sample ID that is used to link to the genomic
data files. Merging data from the NGS report onto the analytic cohort
returned from create_analytic_cohort() therefore allows users to utilize all
clinical and genomic data available.

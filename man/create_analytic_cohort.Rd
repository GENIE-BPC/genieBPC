\usage{
create_analytic_cohort(
  data_synapse,
  index_ca_seq = 1,
  institution,

  histology,
  regimen_drugs,
  regimen_type = "Exact",
  regimen_order,
  regimen_order_type,
  return_summary = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_synapse}{The item from the nested list returned from
pull_data_synapse() that corresponds to the cancer cohort of interest.}

\item{index_ca_seq}{Index cancer sequence. Default is 1, indicating the
patient's first index cancer. The index cancer is also referred to as the
BPC Project cancer in the GENIE BPC Analytic Data Guide; this is the
cancer that met the eligibility criteria for the project and was
selected at random for PRISSMM phenomic data curation.
Specifying multiple index cancer sequences, e.g.
index_ca_seq = c(1, 2) will return index cancers to
patients with 1 index cancer and will return the first AND second index
cancers to patients with multiple.}

\item{institution}{GENIE BPC participating institution. Must be one of
"DFCI", "MSK", "UHN", or "VICC" for NSCLC cohorts; must be one of "DFCI",
"MSK", "VICC" for CRC and BrCa. Default selection is all institutions.
This parameter corresponds to the variable `institution` in the
Analytic Data Guide.}

\item{stage_dx}{Stage at diagnosis. Must be one of "Stage I", "Stage II",
"Stage III", "Stage I-III NOS", "Stage IV". Default selection is all stages.
Note that if this parameter is specified, any cases that are missing stage
information are automatically excluded from the resulting cohort.
This parameter corresponds to the variable `stage_dx` in the
Analytic Data Guide.}

\item{histology}{Cancer histology. For all cancer cohorts except for BrCa
(breast cancer), this parameter corresponds to the variable
`ca_hist_adeno_squamous` and must be one of "Adenocarcinoma",
"Squamous cell", "Sarcoma",
"Small cell carcinoma", "Carcinoma", "Other histologies/mixed tumor".
 For BrCa, this parameter corresponds to the variable
`ca_hist_brca` and must be one of
"Invasive lobular carcinoma", "Invasive ductal carcinoma", "Other histology".
Default selection is all histologies. Note that if this parameter is
specified, any cases that are missing histology information are automatically
excluded from the resulting cohort.}

\item{regimen_drugs}{Vector with names of drugs in cancer-directed regimen,
separated by a comma. For example, to specify a regimen consisting of
Carboplatin and Pemetrexed, specify regimen_drugs = "Carboplatin,
Pemetrexed". Acceptable values are found in the `drug_regimen_list`
dataset provided with this package. This parameter
corresponds to the variable `regimen_drugs` in the Analytic Data Guide.}

\item{regimen_type}{Indicates whether the regimen(s) specified in
`regimen_drugs` indicates the exact regimen to return, or if regimens
containing the drugs listed in `regimen_drugs` should be returned. Must be
one of "Exact" or "Containing". The default is "Exact".}

\item{regimen_order}{Order of cancer-directed regimen. If multiple drugs
are specified, `regimen_order` indicates the regimen order for all drugs;
different values of `regimen_order` cannot be specified for different drug
regimens. If multiple values are specified, e.g. c(1, 2), then drug regimens
that met either order criteria are returned.}

\item{regimen_order_type}{Specifies whether the `regimen_order` parameter
refers to the order of receipt of the drug regimen within the cancer
diagnosis (across all other drug regimens; "within cancer") or the order of
receipt of the drug regimen within the times that that drug regimen was
administered (e.g. the first time carboplatin pemetrexed was received, out
of all times that the patient received carboplatin pemetrexed; "within
regimen"). Acceptable values are "within cancer" and "within regimen".}

\item{return_summary}{Specifies whether a summary table for the cohort is
returned. Default is FALSE. The `gtsummary` package is required to return a
summary table.}
}
\value{
A list of data frames containing clinical and next generation
sequencing information for patients that met the specified criteria.
Optionally, if return_summary = TRUE, the list also includes summary
tables for the number of records per dataset (`tbl_overall_summary`)
as well as tables of key cancer diagnosis (`tbl_cohort`),
cancer-directed regimen (`tbl_drugs`) and next generation sequencing
(`tbl_ngs`) variables.
}
\description{
This function allows the user to create a cohort from the GENIE BPC data
based on cancer diagnosis information such as cancer cohort, treating
institution, histology, and stage at diagnosis, as well as cancer-directed
regimen information including regimen name and regimen order. This function
returns each of the clinical and genomic data files subset on the patients
that met criteria for the analytic cohort. Documentation regarding the
structure and contents of each file can be found in the Analytic Data Guide
corresponding to each data release, as well as in the
\href{https://genie-bpc.github.io/genieBPC/articles/clinical_data_structure_vignette.html}{Clinical Data Structure vignette}.
